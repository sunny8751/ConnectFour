# ConnectFour
Web application for the Connect Four game using HTML, CSS, JSP, and Java Servlets technologies, with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) as the cloud deployment server.

Playable here: https://afternoon-inlet-71999.herokuapp.com

This game allows the player to play against an AI of varying difficulty. The Medium and Hard difficulties were programmed using the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), commonly used in game theory to think of all the game's possibilities multiple steps in advance.

These are the different difficulties:

Easy difficulty- computer makes random moves

Medium difficulty- computer attempts to block basic attempts to win while also trying to win itself

Hard difficulty- computer actively predicts how the player will try to win and blocks these attempts, while also trying to win itself
